# 🌍 Interactive Geography Game

An interactive web application where users can explore countries on a world map and test their geography knowledge.

Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the app allows users to:
- Select continents to focus on
- Click on countries to view info: capital, continent, languages, flag
- Play a quiz where a random country is named and must be identified on the map

The map is implemented using **SVG**, and data is fetched in real-time from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/).

🎯 Educational, fun, and a great way to learn world geography!
